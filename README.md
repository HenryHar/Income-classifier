Repo for the ChairtyML project

This repo contains my 1st project for Udacity's Machine Learning - Introduction Nanodegree program. This is term 1 of the 2-term Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

The goal of this project was to identify individuals who make more then $50,000. The data is taken from a 1994 census. The reason charities are interested with these individuals is that they are more likely to donate to their cause then individuals who do not annually make $50,000.

Version 1 of this upload has the full assignment. Once I get a bit more time I will clean everything up to make it easier to read and follow through.
